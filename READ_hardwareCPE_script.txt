# README: Code Overview of 'hardwareCPE_script.js'

This code performs a specific task involving hardware CPE (Common Platform Enumeration) and CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)
data processing using MongoDB. It connects to the MongoDB server using the `mongo_connect.js` module and executes a script to handle
the data.

## Functions and Control Flow

### `runScript()`
This is the entry point function that starts the execution of the script. It performs the following steps:
1. Establishes connections to the MongoDB collections for hardware CPE and CVE data using the `dbConnectHardwareCPE()` and
   `dbConnectCVE()` functions, respectively.
2. Retrieves a list of all CPE names by calling the `getAllCPENames()` function and passing the `collection1` as an argument.
3. Sets the `size` variable to define the batch size for processing the CPE names.
4. Calls the `getCPEArray()` function, passing the CPE names, the two MongoDB collections, and the batch size as arguments.
5. Handles any errors that occur during the execution and logs them to the console.

### `getAllCPENames(collection1)`
This function retrieves all the distinct CPE model names from the `collection1` MongoDB collection. It follows these steps:
1. Queries the MongoDB collection using the `distinct()` method with the "model" field as the parameter.
2. Returns the array of CPE names.
3. Handles any errors that occur during the execution and throws the error to be caught by the caller.

### `getCPEArray(cpeNames, collection1, collection2, size)`
This function processes the CPE names in batches and returns an array containing the results for each batch. It performs the following
actions:
1. Calls the `createNewHardwareCPECollection()` function to create a new MongoDB collection, `newCollection`, for storing the processed data.
2. Divides the CPE names into batches based on the specified `size` parameter.
3. Iterates through each batch and executes the following steps:
   - Initializes temporary arrays, `tempArr` and `batchErrors`, to store the processed data and any encountered errors.
   - Enters a loop while there are still CPE names remaining in the current batch.
   - Calls the `processBatch()` function to process the CPE names, passing the necessary arguments.
   - Checks if the result from `processBatch()` has an array of versions. If true, adds the result to `tempArr`; otherwise, adds it to `batchErrors`.
   - Once all CPE names in the batch are processed, adds an object to the `cpeArray` array, containing the batch number, the processed data in `tempArr`, and any errors in `batchErrors`.
4. Logs the completion of all batches.
5. Returns the `cpeArray` containing the processed data for each batch.

### `processBatch(batch, collection1, collection2, newCollection)`
This function processes a single batch of CPE names. The steps involved are as follows:
1. Retrieves and removes the first CPE name from the batch using `batch.shift()`.
2. Constructs a MongoDB pipeline with the necessary stages to match the CPE name in `collection1` and project relevant fields.
3. Executes the pipeline using the `aggregate()` method on `collection1` and stores the result in `itemArray`.
4. Iterates through each item in `itemArray` and performs the following actions:
   - Extracts the CPE name from the item and assigns it to the `cpeName` variable.
   - Tries to find CVEs associated with the CPE name by querying `collection2` using the `$elemMatch` operator.
   - Stores the returned CVEs in `cveNameArray`.
   - If an error occurs during the query, assigns an error message to `itemArray[i].cves`.
5. Creates a result object containing the hardware name (`item`) and the associated versions (`itemArray`).
6. Inserts the result object into the `newCollection` using the `insertOne()` method.
7. Returns the result object.

## Global Constants

The code imports the following global constants from the `"../mongo_connect.js"` module:
- `dbConnectHardwareCPE`: Represents the function to establish a connection with the MongoDB collection for hardware CPE data.
- `dbConnectCVE`: Represents the function to establish a connection with the MongoDB collection for CVE data.
- `createNewHardwareCPECollection`: Represents the function to create a new MongoDB collection for storing processed data.

## Running the Code

To run this code and execute the data processing task:
1. Ensure that MongoDB is properly installed and running.
2. Set up the `mongo_connect.js` file with the correct connection details for your MongoDB instance.
3. Install any necessary dependencies, such as the MongoDB driver, using `npm` or your preferred package manager.
4. Execute the code by running the script using Node.js (`node yourScript.js`) or integrate it into your project as needed.
